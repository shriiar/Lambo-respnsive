            <p id="hwp">Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the
                objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established
                marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the
                mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine,
                rear-wheel drive layout.

                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973
                worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to
                Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and
                was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980.</p>

                <p>As of 2011, Lamborghini is structured as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Audi AG named Automobili
                    Lamborghini S.p.A.
                    Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. controls five principal subsidiaries: Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A., a
                    manufacturer of motorcycles; Italdesign Giugiaro S.p.A., a 90.1%-owned design and prototyping firm
                    that provides services to the entire Volkswagen Group; MML S.p.A. (Motori Marini Lamborghini), a
                    manufacturer of marine engine blocks; and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A., which sells Audi and other
                    Volkswagen Group vehicles in Italy.

                    The Lamborghini headquarters and main production site is located in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.
                    With the launch of its Urus SUV, the production site expanded from 80,000 to 160,000 square
                    meters.

                    On 13 November 2020, Stephan Winkelmann, current President of Bugatti, was appointed to be the new
                    CEO of Lamborghini. He takes up his new position as of December 1, 2020.</p>
